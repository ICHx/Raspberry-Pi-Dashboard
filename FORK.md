# My fork

## What is changed?
Functional
- Changed OS to more concise command : lsb_release
- Changed CPU temp to consider multicore
- Hostnamectl -> IP, my embedded environment is systemd-less

Asethetical
- MD Toast are now justified not centred, to make plenty use of limited space.

- Storage is only showing /data, to suit my own need
